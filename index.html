            <h2> Dream Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Master’s student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas
                graduating in May 2021. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree from the BGC Trust University Bangladesh.

                Previously, I worked at Works Applications, Singapore as a Software Engineer, where I worked on
                delivering
                libraries, microservices and distributed multi-tenant architecture to thousands of developers inside the
                company who utilized them to build various products for our customers. Aside from work, I am also an
                open-source enthusiast and have created projects that were listed in GitHub trending.

                My interests lie in solving problems related to large-scale distributed software systems.</p>

                <p>2. The Web Developer RoadMap.|
                    This is not just an article of the sort but a fantastic resource on what it takes to become a Web
                    developer. It lists all the technologies and tools a Web developer should be familiar with.
                    I really liked those mind-maps which appear now in many other places on the web. It effectively
                    complements The Web Developer Bootcamp course, which teaches you most of the technologies mentioned
                    in
                    this roadmap</p>

                    There is no better way to learn but from other people’s experience, and this article presents an
                    opportunity to learn how the author manages to find a full-stack web developer job without relevant
                    work
                    experience, no tech degree, and not even a year of active coding experience.
