            <p>
                I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas
                graduating in May 2021. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree from the BGC Trust University Bangladesh.

                Previously, I worked at Works Applications, Singapore as a Software Engineer, where I worked on
                delivering
                libraries, microservices and distributed multi-tenant architecture to thousands of developers inside the
                company who utilized them to build various products for our customers. Aside from work, I am also an
                open-source enthusiast and have created projects that were listed in GitHub trending.

                My interests lie in solving problems related to large-scale distributed software systems.</p>
